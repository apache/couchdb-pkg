Template: couchdb/mode
Type: select
__Choices: standalone, clustered, none
Default: standalone
_Description: General type of CouchDB configuration:
 Please select the CouchDB server configuration type that best meets your needs.
 .
 For single-server configurations, select standalone mode. This will set up
 CouchDB to run as a single server.
 .
 For clustered configuration, select clustered mode. This will prompt for
 additional parameters required to configure CouchDB in a clustered
 configuration.
 .
 If you prefer to configure CouchDB yourself, select none. You will then
 need to edit /opt/couchdb/etc/vm.args and /opt/couchdb/etc/local.d/*.ini
 yourself. Be aware that this will bypass *all* configuration steps, including
 setup of a CouchDB admin user - leaving CouchDB in "admin party" mode.

Template: couchdb/nodename
Type: string
Default: couchdb@localhost
_Description: CouchDB Erlang node name:
 A CouchDB node has an Erlang node name of the form couchdb@<name>.
 .
 For clustered installations, it is REQUIRED that the node name be of the
 form couchdb@fully.qualified.domain.name. It is also REQUIRED that all nodes
 in the cluster be able to resolve other node names via DNS.
 .
 If you have trouble joining a node to a cluster, double-check that you
 have correctly specified the FQDN for the node name, and that DNS resolution
 for this FQDN works across the cluster.

Template: couchdb/cookie
Type: string
_Description: CouchDB Erlang magic cookie:
 A CouchDB node has an Erlang magic cookie value set at startup.
 .
 This value must match for all nodes in the cluster. If they do not match,
 attempts to connect the node to the cluster will be rejected.

Template: couchdb/bindaddress
Type: string
Default: 127.0.0.1
_Description: CouchDB interface bind address:
 A CouchDB node must bind to a specific network interface. This is done
 via IP address. Only a single address is supported at this time.
 .
 The special value '0.0.0.0' binds CouchDB to all network interfaces.
 .
 The default is 127.0.0.1 (loopback) for standalone nodes, and 0.0.0.0
 (all interfaces) for clustered nodes. In clustered mode, it is not allowed
 to bind to 127.0.0.1.

Template: couchdb/adminpass
Type: password
_Description: Password for the CouchDB "admin" user:
 It is highly recommended that you create a CouchDB admin user, which
 takes CouchDB out of the insecure "admin party" mode. Entering a password
 here will take care of this step for you.
 .
 If this field is left blank, an admin user will not be created.
 .
 A pre-existing admin user will not be overwritten by this package.

Template: couchdb/adminpass_again
Type: password
_Description: Repeat password for the CouchDB "admin" user:

Template: couchdb/adminpass_mismatch
Type: error
_Description: Password input error
 The two passwords you entered were not the same. Please try again.

Template: couchdb/error_setting_password
Type: error
_Description: Unable to set password for the CouchDB "admin" user
 An error occurred while setting the password for the CouchDB
 administrative user. This may have happened because the account
 already has a password, or because of local edits to the
 /opt/couchdb/etc/local.ini file.
 .
 You should check the account's password after the package installation.

Template: couchdb/have_1x_databases
Type: note
_Description: CouchDB 1.x databases found
 During installation, unsharded databases have been detected in the
 /var/lib/couchdb directory. These need migration to be used in
 CouchDB 3.x. You must first install CouchDB 2.x and use the `couchup'
 utility to assist in the migration process, then upgrade to 3.x. Or,
 you can do a clean install of CouchDB 3.x and use replication to
 migrate your databases directly.

Template: couchdb/postrm_remove_databases
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Remove all CouchDB databases?
 The /var/lib/couchdb directory containing all CouchDB databases will
 be removed. This will also clear the stored node name for this machine,
 and remove the couchdb user and group.

Template: couchdb/no_cookie_monsters
Type: error
_Description: Cookie input error
 The Erlang cookie cannot be set to 'monster'. Please try again.

Template: couchdb/no_cookie
Type: error
_Description: Cookie input error
 The Erlang cookie cannot be empty. Please try again.
