# CouchDB Packaging support files

Quickstart:

```shell
$ cd .. && git clone https://github.com/apache/couchdb
$ cd couchdb-pkg && make build-couch $(lsb_release -cs) PLATFORM=$(lsb_release -cs)
```

# Building packages for a release

## Prerequisites

1. Linux running Docker
1. The current user must be capable of running `docker run`.
1. Enough free disk space to download all of the Docker images + build
   CouchDB.

## Running the package build

You can either build packages from a local CouchDB dist tarball (the output
of `make dist`), or from a URL of a published CouchDB dist tarball (such
as the ones on https://couchdb.apache.org/). The package's version number
will be derived from the filename of the CouchDB dist tarball.

Run:

    $ ./make-packages path/to/apache-couchdb-VERSION.tar.gz

or

    $ ./make-packages http://url/to/apache-couchdb-VERSION.tar.gz

Packages will be placed in the `pkgs/` subdirectory.

# Building snaps

## Prerequisites

1. Ubuntu 16.04
1. `sudo apt install snapd snapcraft`

## How to do it

1. Edit `snap/snapcraft.yaml` to point to the correct tag (e.g. `2.1.0`)
1. `snapcraft`
